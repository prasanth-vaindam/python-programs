# Program to demonstrate the rules of Identifiers
# variable names are also known as Identifiers

# Allowed Character set is { A-Z, a-z, 0-9, _ }
# it should start with either alphabet or _
# Below are the valid Identifiers examples

name = "Prasanth"
first_name = "Srikanth"
last_name = "Vaindam"
number1 = 10
number2 = 20
total = number1 + number2

num1 = 100
num2 = 200
Total = num1 + num2

numOne = 1000
numTwo = 2000
TOTAL = num1 + num2
# these are three different variable, because python is case-sensitive
print(total, Total, TOTAL)
_private_var = 10
CONSTANT = "a Constant value will be named in Capital letter"
PI = 3.1459
G = 9.8
Abc = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

# NOTE: We should not use keywords for identifiers
# if klj else in not and or lkjsd go skjfe print
# print = 1 - this gives a warning
# in = 10 - this is a keyword
# sdlfgjk'fdlkj = 1 -> this is invalid
# 1num = 50 -
# name@age = sunil@20
